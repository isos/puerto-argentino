<p> The report builder tool provides administrators with the ability to create, 
    copy, edit, delete, import and export database driven reports and forms. Pre-defined 
    reports are stored in the language directory labeled specified for the given 
    language. After installing the plug-in, there may be several standard reports and forms    
	installed. More reports or forms can be added by importing them from either the 
    host servers reports directory or uploading them directly from the browser. 
    Standard reports can be viewed and customized through the Report Viewer. Forms may only be edited through Report builder. The Report Viewer manual covers the output procedures 
    necessary for exporting or viewing reports created with the report builder.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATABASES AND FIELDS IS REQUIRED TO USE REPORT BUILDER! FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN ERRORS OR NON-FUNCTIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS.</p>
<h2><a name="RB_NewRpt">How Do I Create a New Report?</a></h2>
<p> There are five steps to building a report. They are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Entering the report name and category. </li>
  <li>Setting up the page layout.</li>
  <li> Specifying the database tables and link equations. </li>
  <li>Entering and arranging a list of possible fields to display. </li>
  <li>Entering and arranging date, grouping, sorting, and filter criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p> The best way to demonstrate how to build a report would be to show an example. 
            We'll build a report called: Invoice Report. First we'll need to access the 
            report builder. It is found under the Setup menu under the General 
            category titled Report Builder Tool. Once there press the Add New button.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Report name and group category</h3>
<p>For our report, enter Invoice Report into the Enter a name text box. Also, we 
              need to specify that it is a report by selecting the Report radio button. We now need to place this report under the proper category so select Receivables 
              from the drop down menu for the group this report is a part of.      </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/RBRptName.jpg"></p>
<p>Press Continue when all information has been entered.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: At this time a record will be added to the reports table and will 
                  appear in the list of available reports. Users can choose this report to 
                  generate but the result will be a 'No data in this report' warning. The report 
                  should be deleted if the report builder process is not completed for a given 
                  report.          </p>
<h3>Step 2. Setting up the page layout</h3>
<p>The next screen allows us to alter some of the default settings for the layout 
                    of the report. Most fields are self explanatory but there are a few notes to 
                    remember.</p>
<p><strong>Page layout</strong>: You should set the default paper size to what you really want it to 
                    be. It cannot be changed when viewing standard reports. You may return here to make further changes by 
                    editing the report after you finish building the report testing the output.</p>
<p><strong>Column Width</strong>: If you have a pretty good idea of how many columns you want your 
                    report to be and the width, you can enter them here. If you leave the defaults 
                    for now and finish your report you may go back and change the column widths 
            after you test you finished product at a later time.</p>
<p> <strong>Titles</strong>: Data will appear as it is typed but there are system generated tags to 
                    automate the report. This list is current as of this writing but may change as 
            more tags are added.</p>
<table align="center" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">Tag</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Description</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%date%</td>
    <td>Inserts the current date into the title in the place the tag appears within the title string.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%reportname%</td>
    <td>Inserts the report name stored in the database.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Margin and column widths are in millimeters, font sizes are in points.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/RBPageSetup.jpg" width="721" height="456"></p>
<p>After all information has been entered, press Continue to enter the database 
                    information.</p>
<h3>Step 3. Specifying the database tables and link equations</h3>
<p>This form allows us to specify the tables and linked tables that are used to 
                      build the query. These fields generate what will become the second part of the 
                      query, "FROM  table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table2linkequation INNER JOIN table3 
                      ON etc".</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: IMPORTANT: KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATABASE TABLES AND STRUCTURE IS REQUIRED.</p>
<p>Enter the data in the boxes as shown below. Only one row of data may be entered at a time in sequence. After each table/Link Equation row has been entered, press the Update button to validate the table and commit the link equation. The form will reload with data just entered and will then allow the next Table/Link Equation to be entered. The fields are case sensitive.    </p>
<table align="center" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">Text Box Name</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Data to Enter</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Table Name - Primary</td>
    <td>salesorders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Table Name - Second</td>
    <td>salesorderdetails</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Link Equation - Second</td>
    <td>salesorders.orderno = salesorderdetails.orderno</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Table Name - Third</td>
    <td>debtorsmaster</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Link Equation - Third</td>
    <td>salesorders.debtorno = debtorsmaster.debtorno</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Table Name - Fourth</td>
    <td>custbranch</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Link Equation - Fourth</td>
    <td>salesorders.branchcode = custbranch.branchcode</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: After the data has been entered, the tool will validate the data by 
attempting to retrieve a single row from the query. If a single row cannot be 
  accessed from the database, you cannot progress past this point.</p>
<p> <strong>NOTE</strong>: If you get stuck here, remember that the report exists in the standard 
  reports list and should be deleted to prevent users from running the report.  </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/RBDbSetup.jpg" width="647" height="336"></p>
<p>After all information has been entered, press Continue to enter the possible 
  fields to query.</p>
<h3>Step 4. Specifying the possible fields to retrieve</h3>
<p>This form will add the allowed fields to a query build list. These fields 
    generate will become the first part of the query, "SELECT field list here". At 
                            least one field needs to be entered to make a valid report. Up to the total 
                            number of fields in the linked databases provided in step 3 are allowed. In 
                            practice, however, a smaller list usually works the best. Each field has it's 
                            own attributes. They can be re-sequenced, force a column break, set to show and 
                            marked to track a running total. Only the fields added here will appear in the 
                            report viewer list for selection.</p>
<p><strong>PRACTICAL NOTE</strong>: It's a good idea to pre-order the fields in a logical order in 
                            the way you want to the data to appear. Also, selecting the fields to show 
                            combined with the column breaks should result in a default report of eight 
                            columns or less so they can be displayed directly from the standard report 
                            without modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Order</strong>: The order determines the sequence of the generation of the field list. If an order number is entered that already exists, it will be inserted into the list in the order specified and the remaining fields will be bumped down one position. If the order number is left out, it will append the new field to the end of the list. Order numbers begin with 1.</p>
<p> <strong>Fieldname</strong>: This text field needs to match the exact table and fieldname in the 
                            database. The fieldname is entered in the form 'table.fieldname' to provide 
                            absolute identification of the field to be retrieved. A test to retrieve a 
                            single line form the database with the fieldname and display description will be 
                            performed to validate the input. If the fieldname is incorrect or the display 
                            description is blank, an error will result.</p>
<p><strong>Name to Display</strong>: The description can be any English (or other language) 
                            description. This is the ID assigned to the fieldname. It will appear on the 
                            report heading and links directly to the table.fieldname entry. Special 
                            characters are allowed but not recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Break</strong>: This field specifies whether there should be a column break after this 
                            entry is displayed. The field can only be altered in the Report Viewer for 
                            custom reports so it's best to get it right in the standard report to generate 
                            the desired output. It is a good idea to group certain fields in the same 
                            column. For example, addresses typically read better if they appear in a block 
                            versus spread out over several columns. Also, the report is limited to eight 
                            columns to display. Most standard reports will list more than eight fields and 
                            using column breaks will help organize the output.</p>
<p><strong>Show</strong>: Identifies the fields to display. Only fields that are checked to show 
                            will appear in the report. It is a good practice to show the fields that you 
                            want to appear in the standard report but not necessarily all fields. The user 
                            can decide what pieces of data they want and alter this field only in custom 
                            reports. If no fields are identified to show, the report viewer will generate a 
                            warning message 'No data to display'.</p>
<p><strong>Total</strong>: Specifies if a running total should be kept. Can be set for any numeric 
                            field. If grouping is set, the report viewer will also track subtotals by the 
                            group selected as well as the total for all field retrieved in the report.</p>
<p>Let's add some fields to our report. We'll use an abbreviated list to show the 
                            general idea. If more fields are needed or need to be edited, the report may be 
                            edited and fields added or deleted as necessary. Enter the fields as shown in 
                            the table below.      </p>

</table>
<p>  If you make an error, the buttons on the right of each row entered allow you to 
edit, re-sequence, or delete a row. Your form should like something like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/RBFldSetup.jpg" width="762" height="405"></p>
<p>After all information has been entered, press Continue to enter the filter 
  criteria.  </p>
<h3>Step 5. Entering and arranging criteria</h3>
<p>This form builds the options for date selection, grouping, sorting, and 
    filtering for the standard report. These fields generate what will become the where of 
    the query, "WHERE criteria1 AND criteria 2 AND etc ORDER BY grouping, sorting". 
                                Here's how each field works:</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: If your report has a date field that is displaying, this is where you will 
                                specify the type of data choices available. Many are just quick selections to 
                                standard periods of time. The two most generic, ALL and RANGE allow the user to 
                                quickly view every entry in the database or specify the particular date range 
                                they are interested in. For all date selections (except ALL), the table name and 
                                fieldname 'table.fieldname' must be entered into the Date Fieldname text box or 
                                an sql error will result. The fieldname will be tested with the selected tables 
                                to validate the input. A default date can be chosen hare as well. For example, If 
                                a standard report named Today's Sales is being generated, you may still want to 
                                allow the user to select a date range but you want the date to first come up 
                                with Today as the default. In this case, you would select as many date choices 
                                as you wish but upon entry to the report, Today will be the default.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If your report doesn't have any date fields, or doesn't depend on date 
                                information, either de-select all the check boxes in which case the date options 
                                will not be displayed in the report viewer or just check the ALL box to show the 
                                date option with only a single choice available.</p>
<p><strong>Truncate Long Descriptions</strong>: This is handy for summary reports or when a field is 
                                long and you want to avoid column wraps of the text. Checking this box truncates 
                                any field that will exceed the column width to keep it to one line. This feature 
                                also truncates the column headings.</p>
<p><strong>Grouping Fields</strong>:<br /> 
  <strong>Sorting Fields</strong>: Grouping Fields and Sorting Fields are similar. The main 
                                difference being the grouping is specified earlier in the ORDER BY portion of 
                                the sql string and subtotaling is calculated and displayed on the report. If no 
                                groupings are specified, the option will not show in the Report Viewer criteria 
selection form.</p>
<p><strong>Default</strong>: Checking the default box will pre-select a particular group and/or sort 
                                field. These choices may be altered in both the standard reports and the custom 
                                reports but saves time if your target report is designed to have a specific 
            grouping or sorting.</p>
<p> <strong>Filter Criteria</strong>: The filter criteria allows for user options to further refine 
                                their search. There are no limit to the number of options but usually 3-4 work 
                                the best. The type of criteria must make sense relative to the field. If the 
                                field is a text field, the all:range criteria work best. For yes/no fields, the 
                                all:yes:no, printed:unprinted, etc work the best.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Grouping Display Fieldname must match exactly the Fieldname in the 
                                Field List for the Group Subtotal to function properly. The report fields will 
                                still be grouped properly but the subtotals and group breaks will not be 
                                displayed.</p>
<p>Let's fill in our report with the following data:</p>
<p>1. Check all the date boxes except the 'to-date' boxes. This will give the user 
more than enough choices. <br />2. Enter salesorders.orddate in the Date Fieldname text box. <br />3. Check No in Truncate Long Descriptions. We can change it later if necessary.<br /> 4. Enter the Grouping as follows:      </p>
<table align="center"  border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">Sequence</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Fieldname</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Display Description</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Default </div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">1</div></td>
    <td>salesorders.orddate</td>
    <td>Order Date</td>
    <td><div align="center">No</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">2</div></td>
    <td>salesorders.orderno</td>
    <td>Order Number</td>
    <td><div align="center">No</div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>5. Enter the Sorting as follows:      </p>
<table align="center"  border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">Sequence</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Fieldname</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Display Description</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Default</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">1</div></td>
    <td>debtorsmaster.name</td>
    <td>Customer Name</td>
    <td><div align="center">Yes</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">2</div></td>
    <td>salesorders.orderno</td>
    <td>Order Number</td>
    <td><div align="center">No</div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>6. Enter the Field Criteria as follows: </p>
<table align="center"  border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">Sequence</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Fieldname</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Display Description</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">Type of Criteria</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">1</div></td>
    <td>salesorders.branchcode</td>
    <td>Branch ID</td>
    <td><div align="center">All:Range</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">2</div></td>
    <td>salesorders.orderno</td>
    <td>Order Number</td>
    <td><div align="center">All:Range</div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">3</div></td>
    <td>salesorders.quotation</td>
    <td>Quotation</td>
    <td><div align="center">All:Yes:No </div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Notice that we allow the user to filter based on salesorders.quotation 
                                  even though the field is not listed in the Field List. The Report viewer will 
                                  still use the field to filter the data even though you may not want the field to 
                                  display. This is usually not a good idea in practice. The output report header 
                                  will indicate that the filter criteria included quotation if Quotation: Yes or 
                                  Quotation: No is selected to show that the report only contains filtered data.</p>
