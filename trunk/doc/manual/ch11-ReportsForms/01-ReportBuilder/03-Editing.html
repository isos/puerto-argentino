  <h2><a name="RB_Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p> The report builder tool provides administrators with the ability to create, 
    copy, edit, delete, import and export database driven reports and forms. Pre-defined 
    reports are stored in the language directory labeled specified for the given 
    language. After installing the plug-in, there may be several standard reports and forms    
	installed. More reports or forms can be added by importing them from either the 
    host servers reports directory or uploading them directly from the browser. 
    Standard reports can be viewed and customized through the Report Viewer. Forms may only be edited through Report builder. The Report Viewer manual covers the output procedures 
    necessary for exporting or viewing reports created with the report builder.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATABASES AND FIELDS IS REQUIRED TO USE REPORT BUILDER! FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN ERRORS OR NON-FUNCTIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS.</p>

<h3> <img src="../../../../themes/default/icons/32x32/actions/edit-find-replace.png" width="32" height="32"> Editing a report</h3>
<p>Standard and Custom reports can be edited by simply selecting the report to edit 
        and pressing Edit. The following several menus are the same as defined in the 
        Create a new report below. The report builder is the only place that standard 
        reports can be changed. In the Report Viewer, the user is limited only to the 
        selection of criteria, no page setup or field property changes are allowed. In 
        the Report Viewer, custom report modifications are more flexible where the user 
        can adjust the page properties,  field properties and criteria. The Report 
        Viewer will not allow the user to add, change or delete and fields or criteria, 
        just their properties.</p>
<h3> <img src="../../../../themes/default/icons/32x32/actions/edit-copy.png" width="32" height="32"> Copying a report</h3>
<p>Reports may be copied by selecting a report and pressing Copy. Enter the name of 
        the new report and the group it will be displayed with. All copied reports are 
        saved as the same type of report as the original, standard or custom.</p>
<h3><img src="../../../../themes/default/icons/32x32/actions/edit-find.png" width="32" height="32"> Renaming a report</h3>
<p>Renaming a report is similar to copying a report except the report is 
        overwritten with the new report name and the report group cannot be changed. If 
        you need to move a report to a different group, copy the report to that group 
        and delete the original report.</p>
<h3><img src="../../../../themes/default/icons/32x32/actions/edit-delete.png" width="32" height="32" border="0"> Deleting a report</h3>
<p>To delete a report, select the report and press Delete. A confirmation window 
        will pop-up to confirm the deletion before the report is removed. If a report is 
        accidentally deleted, it may be possible to import it back again if it was a 
        report from the distribution or exported and saved as backup.</p>
