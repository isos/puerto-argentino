PhreeBooks has a built-in automatic installation system. However to use this you must first unpack
the code to a web server.

The web server can either be on your local computer or on an internet host.

To start off, you should have to extract the PhreeBooks(tm) ZIP file. How you do this depends on the operating system you use.

Once extracted, you will have a directory containing the PhreeBooks(tm) scripts.

The contents of this directory needs to be moved to your webserver, either by copying the directory or by using an FTP progam.

You will then need to run the install script.

To do this you need to open a browser and type in the URL.

If you are running on a your own computer, this will be

   http://localhost/{phreebooks-directory}/index.php

or if on a live server:

   http://{www.mydomain.com}/index.php

You will be notified that the configure.php file does not exist and a link will be provided to start the installation script.

Follow the prompts to install PhreeBooks(tm).
