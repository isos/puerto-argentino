  <h2><a name="RB_Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p> The report builder tool provides administrators with the ability to create, 
    copy, edit, delete, import and export database driven reports and forms. Pre-defined 
    reports are stored in the language directory labeled specified for the given 
    language. After installing the plug-in, there may be several standard reports and forms    
	installed. More reports or forms can be added by importing them from either the 
    host servers reports directory or uploading them directly from the browser. 
    Standard reports can be viewed and customized through the Report Viewer. Forms may only be edited through Report builder. The Report Viewer manual covers the output procedures 
    necessary for exporting or viewing reports created with the report builder.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE DATABASES AND FIELDS IS REQUIRED TO USE REPORT BUILDER! FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN ERRORS OR NON-FUNCTIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS.</p>
<h2><a name="RB_ImpExp">Importing and Exporting</a></h2>
<p> An important feature of the Report Builder is it's ability to import and export 
      report and form parameters. This feature allows one user to generate a report on their webERP 
      system and export it to his local file system where it can then be e-mailed, 
      transferred or imported into another webERP system. There is also a provision to 
      alter the naming within the report to allow for language translations for the 
      field descriptions.</p>
<p>There are two types of importing types supported. First, packaged standard 
      reports shipped with PhreeBooks are stored in the /language/en_us/ directory (or 
      the language directory specified in the appropriate translation) where they can 
      be selected for import. Entering a report name and selecting 'Import' will 
      install the report into the group defined in the report file with the report 
      file name specified. If the report filename is left blank, the default report 
      name specified in the import file will be used. Second, a report file can be 
      uploaded through the browser and imported into the group specified in the report 
      file. If a report name is specified, the report will be saved under the 
      specified name, but if left blank, the default report name contained in the 
      uploaded file will be used.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Standard reports will be imported into the Standard Reports listing and 
      custom reports will be imported into the Custom Reports listing. The report type 
      is specified in the uploaded report file.</p>
<p>Exporting downloads the report file to the uses browser and can either be viewed 
      or saved. The file format is type 'text' and must be saved as a text file. 
      Report Builder uses the extension .rpt.txt for files contained in the 
      distribution package.      </p>
<h3>Editing an exported report file</h3>
<p>Report and form files can be edited to support multi-language users. The text file my 
      be edited with any text editor. Only modify the descriptions between the single 
      quotes and leave the remaining portions of the file untouched. A translation 
section example is shown below:</p>
<p> /* Language Fields. */<br /> /* Only modify the language portion between the single quotes after the colon. 
*/<br />
<br /> 
/* Report Name and Title Information: */<br /> ReportName:'Invoice' <br />Title1Desc:'%reportname%'<br />Title2Desc:'report generated %date%'<br />
<br />/* Report Field Description Information: */<br /> FieldDesc0:'Branch ID' <br />FieldDesc1:'Order Number' <br />FieldDesc2:'Quotation' <br />
FieldDesc4:'Order Number'
        <br />
  FieldDesc5:'Order Date'
  <br />
  FieldDesc6:'Branch ID'
  <br />
  FieldDesc7:'Customer Reference'
  <br />
  FieldDesc8:'Deliver To Name'
  <br />
  FieldDesc9:'Quantity'<br />
  FieldDesc10:'Part Number'
  <br />
  FieldDesc11:'Unit Price'
  <br />
  FieldDesc12:'Customer Name'
  <br />
  FieldDesc13:'Address 1'
  <br />
  FieldDesc14:'Address 2'
  <br />
  FieldDesc15:'City'<br />
  FieldDesc16:'State'<br />
  FieldDesc17:'Postal Code'<br />
  FieldDesc18:'Country'<br />
  FieldDesc19:'Delivery Date
  <br />
  FieldDesc20:'Customer Branch ID'
  <br />
  FieldDesc21:'Order Date'
  <br />
  FieldDesc22:'Order Number'<br />
  FieldDesc23:'Customer Name'<br />
  FieldDesc24:'Order Number'<br />
/* End of language fields. */</p>
<p> In this example, the report name is 'Invoice'. To change the report name to 
        Invoice Register, simply change the word 'Invoice' with 'Invoice Register'. 
        Language changes can also be made here for translation and the report saved in 
        the languages directory appropriate for the language used.</p>
